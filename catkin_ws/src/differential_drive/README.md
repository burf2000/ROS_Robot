# ROS differential_drive package (catkin-compatible)

For detailed documentation and tutorials see the [package website](http://wiki.ros.org/differential_drive), as I haven't changed the actual nodes (just repackaged them to work with catkin).

The original source code can be found [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/differential-drive/).
